        "servings": "6 To 8",
        "instructions": "The World Of Jewish Cooking, Gil Marks Ful is the Arabic word for 'fava beans'. This dish is also called salat lubiya (bean salad). Although fava bean salads, inexpensive and flavorful, are commonplace throughout the Near East and North Africa, the eggs are a distinctive Jewish touch. Serve ful as a salad, side dish, or part of a meze (appetizer assortment). Soak the beans in water to cover overnight. Drain. Place the beans in a 4-quart saucepan and add the 3 quarts of water. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce the heat to medium, stirring occasionally for 30 minutes. Stir in the oil, salt, and pepper. Add the eggs. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally and adding ore water if necessary, until the beans are very tender,about 2 hours. Remove the eggs, peel, and chop or quarter. Add the lemon juice and parsley to the beans, tossing to coat. Divide among serving bowls and top with the eggs. Serve warm or chilled. Note: Dried fava beans are available in Middle Eastern and Italian groceries and in some specialty food stores. Since fava beans are sometimes hard to find, dried white beans, large dried lima beans, or chickpeas can be substituted. VARIATIONS: PUL MEDAMES (Sephardic Baked Fava Beans Cook the beans and eggs, covered, overnight over very lowheat and serve on Sabbath morning for desayuno (breakfast)). When simmered overnight this dish becomes a Sabbath stew similar to hamin. SYRIAN FUL Add 1-1/2 teaspoons ground cumin and 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes or a pinch of cayenne. YEMENITE FUL Spoon 2 tablespoons tarator bi tahina (sesame seed sauce) over each serving of beans. Note: To make tarator bi tahina (yield 1-1/3 cups)"
